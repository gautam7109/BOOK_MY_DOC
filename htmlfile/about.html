	<h2>ABOUT US!</h2><br>
	<h3>     The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system<br> that provides patients or any user an easy way of booking a<br> doctor appointment online. This is a web based application<br> that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appoint<br>-ments according to users choice or demands.The task some<br>-times becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor<br>himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as <br>per their availability.Hence this project offers an effective <br>solution where users can view various booking slots avai<br>-lable and select the preferred date and time.
